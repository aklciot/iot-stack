# iot-stack
This will build a complete full IoT stack on a number of different computer types. There are q few things required so we use [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) to get them all running on one computer. Docker canrun on a Raspberry Pi, on Windows or Linux.

[Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) is used to run the system, it come pre-installed on Docker for Windows, but you need to nstall it on Linux (and the raspberry Pi).
